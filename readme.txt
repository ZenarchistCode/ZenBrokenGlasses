[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod simply adds a broken glass visual effect to damaged glasses (wearable) and optics (scopes) which don't already have a damage visual effect in-game.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod can be theoretically be installed client-side only as it doesn't do anything server-side, but I don't know how you do that so I just recommend running it as a normal server + client mod (or repack it).

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
